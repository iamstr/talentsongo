Oh-ho...the future, I can tell you about the future. (Railroad Tracks - Morning) (Marty is just waking up, lifting his head from the barrel of his gun which he slept on top of the entire night.)(v.o) Serving Hill Valley and all of Hill County, you're tuned to KKHV, the voice of Hill Valley. (Biff adjusts the tuning a bit. Marty looks at Doc and gives him a thumbs-up. Doc gives one back and then the DeLorean flies off.) Turning to the community calendar, the Hill Valley Women's Club Bake Sale will be held tomorrow afternoon from 2-5 at the Community Center on Horace Road. (Marty appears in the background. During the following Marty moves around the car until he's hanging onto the side of it.) For you sports fans out there, there was a lot of action today in college football. Here's what happened in the top 10. UCLA narrowly defeated Washington 19-17. (Marty sees the Sports Almanac in the back of the car.) Michigan State crushed Minnesota 42-14. (Biff grabs the almanac just as Marty tries to grab it.) Ohio State beat Iowa 20-10. Michigan blanked Indiana 30-0. (Biff is checking these results in the almanac.) (muttering) Shit. Son of a bitch! (v.o) Oklahoma ripped Ohio State 52-0. (Biff puts the almanac on the seat next to him. Marty spots his chance!) West Virginia lost to Pittsburgh 26-7. (Marty quietly opens the car door.) Maryland defeated Clemson 25-12. Repeating tonight's earlier weather bulletin, a severe thunderstorm is heading for Hill Valley. (Biff looks around and sees Marty. Marty tries to grab the almanac. Biff turns to face the front again, before suddenly realising who it is and turning round again. He grabs the book, as does Marty, and they are having a tug of war over it.) </p>
