                        There are plenty worse places to be than the Old West. I could've ended up in the Dark Ages. They probably would've burned me at the stake as a heretic or something. Let's look at the map. It says here the time vehicle is buried here in a side tunnel. We may have to blast. (Delgato Mine) (Doc and Marty blow open the entrance to the mine.) Whoa. I think you woke up the dead with that blast. Take this camera... I want to document everything!Who me? Yes, be a pal and hand my five-eighths wrench out of that toolbox. Five-eighths? Don't you mean three-quarters? Why, you're right. I presume you're conducting some sort of weather experiment.(Doc walks in looking utterly depressed.) Emmett! What can I get you, the usual? No, Chester, I'm gonna need something a lot stronger than that tonight. Certainty in his voice. Sarsaparilla. Whiskey, Chester.You look great, Doc. (looks around, and mutters to himself.) The future...unbelievable...(to Doc) I gotta check this out Doc. All in good time Marty, we're on a tight schedule here. Tell me about my future. I mean, I know I make it big, but what do I become like a rich rock star or something? Please Marty, no-one should know too much about their own destiny. Right, right...I am rich though?Yeah, I'm…mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. A colored mayor, that'll be the day. You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town. Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that.Hey, hey, thanks. Of course, you understand that if you lose...I'm taking it back. (He smiles and walks away.) (Marty stares after the gun salesman dumbfounded.) Thanks again. (Marty walks the other direction and runs into Maggie and Seamus. Maggie is carrying William. They continue along together.)(Train) (Marty is in the Delorean, which is hooked up to the front of the train. Doc is in the front of the train. The train whistle blows.) (into walkie-talkie) Ready to roll! (There is a shot of Clara following them. She can see them now, but they cannot see her.) EMMETT!(w.t) Listen Doc, Biff's guys chased me into the gym and they're gonna jump...me! (DeLorean) (w.t) Then get out of there! (v.o) No Doc, not me, the other me, the one's that's up on stage playing Johnny B Goode! (w.t) Great Scott! Your other self will miss the lightning bolt at the clock tower, you won't get back to the future and we'll have a major paradox!Emmett... Clara...I want you know that I care about you deeply, but I realize that I don't belong here, and I have to go back to where I came from. And where might that be? ...I can't tell you. Well, wherever you're going, take me with you!Mom? Mom, is that you? (She opens the door to reveal Grandma Lorraine.) Grandma Lorraine! Sweetheart! (They kiss.) What happened to Grandpa? Oh, he put his back out again. (She steps back to reveal George. He’s attached to a hovering device and is upside down.)Hey, Doc...where ya goin' now? Back to the future? From the cab window, he shakes his head. Nope. Already been there! (he waves at Marty and Jennifer) (Marty and Jennifer wave back, and the time train rises into the air and suddenly gains speed and disappears. The screen blackens and we see...THE END.)Get your meat hooks off of me. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, (Biff stands up and he's at least a foot taller than Marty) uh please. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a… (spots Strickland over Marty's shoulder) since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. (Street) (George is walking home and Marty catches up to him.)
